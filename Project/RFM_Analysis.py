# Bussines Problem:

"""
The UK-based retail company wants to segment its customers and determine its marketing strategies according to these segments.
He thinks that conducting special marketing studies for customer segments that exhibit common behaviors will increase revenues.

Accordingly, RFM Analysis will be used according to segments in this project.
"""

# About the Dataset:
"""
The data set named Online Retail II includes online sales transactions of a UK-based retail company between 
01/12/2009 - 09/12/2011. The company's product catalog includes souvenirs and it is known 
that most of its customers are wholesalers.
"""

"""
- InvoiceNo : Invoice Number (Additional information: If this code starts with C, it means that the transaction has been cancelled.)
- StackCode : Product Code (Unique for each product)
- Description : Product Name
- Quantity : Number of Products (How many of the products on the invoice were sold)
- InvoiceDate : Invoice Date
- UnitPrice : Invoice Price (in Sterling)
- CustomerID : Unique Customer Number
- Country : Country Name
